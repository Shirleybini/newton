```ngMeta
name: String
```

## Example:

```javascript
var greet1 = 'Hi Nayak!';  // using single quotes
```

```javascript
var greet2 = "Hi Nayak!";  // using double quotes
```
 
In the above example the variable a contains a greeting which is saying **Hi Nayak**, if you see the saying that is actually a **string**. 
 
The string data type is used to represent textual data (i.e. sequences of characters). Strings are created using 'single' or "double quotes" surrounding one or more characters, as shown below:


```javascript
var name='kumar'
console.log(name);
output : kumar
```
```javascript
var name="kumar"
console.log(name);
output : kumar
```

You can include quotes inside the string as long as they don't match the enclosing quotes.

### Example:

```javascript
var a = "I’m going to the classroom"; // single quote inside double quotes
```

If you observe the above example, in variable a we have a sentence that is I’m going to the classroom, in this sentence if you see a single quote is there after I ,it won’t create a problem that is not matching with enclosing quotes because enclosing quotes are double quotes.

```javascript
var b = 'He said "bye" and went out.';  // double quotes inside single quotes
```

If you observe the above example, in variable b we have a sentence that is He said "bye" and went out.  In this sentence if you see a double quote for bye inside a single quote  ,it won’t create a problem that is not matching with enclosing quotes because enclosing quotes are double quotes.

```javascript
var c = 'We\'ll never leave you.';     // escaping single quote with backslash
```

If you observe the above example, if we have single quotes inside single quotes then it will create a problem for you to resolve that issue you need to use an escape sequence.
