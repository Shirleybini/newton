Javascript is a high-level scripting and interpreted programming language. Now, there are three important phrases to understand here. High level, Scripting, and Interpreted.

- High Level Language :- High-Level Language is a language which humans can understand and write easily. For example, English can be read by us easily. And JavaScript code also can be read by us humans easily.
- Scripting Language :- Scripting language is a language which converts our human-readable code into machine code. Machine code, as you may know, exists as 1s and 0s  and we will call it a low level language also.
- Interpreted Programming Language :- An Interpreter read over the JavaScript code, one line at a time, and runs it. Javascript is run by Interpreter. Some other languages, like Java, for instance, are run by something called a Compiler. A compiler does not run the code line by line. Instead, it reads the entire code and then runs it.
