	"defining-lists_key3": "Whenever you see `[`, then think that list definition has started, and when you see `]`, then think that list definition is ending.\n",
	"defining-lists_key4": "### Some Examples\n\n\n",
	"defining-lists_key5": "In this example, we will store the names of students in a list.\n",
	"defining-lists_key6": "In the last line, we have used `type ()`. By using this function we will come to know that what is its data type.\n",
	"defining-lists_key7": "This is the `list of `strings`` because all of its values contain `strings`.\n",
	"defining-lists_key8": "**Please note that to start a `List`, `[` is used and to close `]` is used. `[]` looks like a square shape, that is why these are called `SQUARE BRACKETS`.**\n",
	"defining-lists_key9": "We can put any object inside a `list`. This can be `string, `integer`` or any other data type.\n",

	"defining-lists_key15": "This is the list of temperatures for the last seven days.\n",
	"defining-lists_key16": "But if we will use the type function on a list `variable`, it will always show the type as a list. But the data inside a list can be of any type.\n",

	"defining-lists_key18": "Make a `list` of your friends.\n",
