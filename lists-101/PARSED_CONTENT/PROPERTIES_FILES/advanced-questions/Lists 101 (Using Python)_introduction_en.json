	"introduction_key2": "In this section, some questions are given. Solutions to some of the questions are given. If you want you can directly see the questions. But, that will not help you at all. It would be better if you first try by yourself for at least 1 hour and then for 0.5 hrs try with the help of your friend and then only watch the solution. There is no better way to clarify your concepts.\n",
	"introduction_key3": "For the solutions that don't have any video, you can try creating videos for that solutions. By this, you will be able to understand the concepts with more clarity and this will help with interview preparation. You can make videos and `upload` them below the questions and together with the links you can give as comments. This way you will also learn how to understand any concept and will also help in preparing for the interviews.\n",
	"introduction_key4": "While doing these questions, you don't have to use any function which is not explained in saral. By doing this, you will learn how to solve a given problem. This is very important for us to know that how we will solve a problem.\n"
