	"definition-part-2_key2": "### Binary Numbers\n\n\n",
	"definition-part-2_key3": "Binary numbers are known as machine language or low level language ,binary numbers are made of 0 and 1 which humans cannot understand but computers can.\n",
	"definition-part-2_key4": "### `Interpreter` \n\n\n",
	"definition-part-2_key5": "It checks the `code` line by line and the line at which `error` is present, `interpreter`  stops the `code` at that line and shows the name of `error`.\n`Interpreter`  converts high level language to low level language with the help of which the computer is able to run the `code`.\n",
	"definition-part-2_key6": "**`Interpreter` is used for `Python` and Ruby programming languages.**\n",
	"definition-part-2_key7": "**Example :-**\n",
	"definition-part-2_key8": "`Output `\n`file \"<`string`>\",line 1, in <module>`\n",
	"definition-part-2_key9": "In  this example you saw that I have taken a `variable` named **a** and assigned/given  a `string` value to it but I forgot to put \" \"(quote).So, `python` was not able to identify the type of value I gave to the `variable` **a**.Therefore, the `interpreter` stopped the `code` at the line that contained `error`, and displayed the `error`.\n",
	"definition-part-2_key10": "### `Compiler`\n\n\n",
	"definition-part-2_key11": "`Compiler` is a software that scans the complete `code` in one go and if the `code` contains any `error`  ,then it shows the `error` at the end of the `code`.\nWhereas the `interpreter`, stops the `code` at the line that contains `error`.\n",
	"definition-part-2_key12": "**`Compiler` is used in C and C++ programming languages.**\n",

	"definition-part-2_key17": "Case sensitive means that the text that we have typed should be exactly same as we type it anywhere in the `code`.\n",

	"definition-part-2_key19": "`Output`\n",
	"definition-part-2_key20": "`Var is not defined`\n",
	"definition-part-2_key21": "For example ,in the above example ,we have assigned a  `variable` named **var** and while printing we typed **Var** ,so an `error` was displayed because in `python` var and Var are different. In `python` small letters and capital letters are considered different.\n",

	"definition-part-2_key28": "`SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing`\n",
	"definition-part-2_key29": "`Output`\n",
	"definition-part-2_key30": "`SyntaxError: invalid `syntax``\n",
	"definition-part-2_key31": "In this example you saw that while printing I forgot to put parenthesis so it showed us a `syntax` `error` which means our `code` has some mistake/`error`.\n",
	"definition-part-2_key32": "### Debugs\n\n\n",
	"definition-part-2_key33": "Debug means to solve bug/`error` in the given `code` or removing the `error` from the `code` and writing the correct `code` which is as per the `syntax`.\n",

	"definition-part-2_key39": "As you saw in the bug example   there was a bug present in the second `code` so we debugged that `code`.\n",
	"definition-part-2_key40": "### Source `code`\n\n\n",
	"definition-part-2_key41": "Source `code` is that `code` which humans can easily understand .\n**Example** \n",
	"definition-part-2_key42": "`Output`\n",
	"definition-part-2_key43": "`python`\n",
	"definition-part-2_key44": "In this example you saw that we have taken a `variable` named as **name** and we have stored `python` in it.Ypu can easily read and understand this `code` .This `code` is called source `code`/main `code`.\n"
